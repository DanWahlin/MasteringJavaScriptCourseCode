    This example demonstrates the effect of putting a property in a prototype. A Person prototype
    defines an orderCount property that is updated each time an addOrder() function is called:
    <br /><br />
    <pre>
        Person.prototype.addOrder = function (order) {
            console.log('Added order: ' + order);
            Person.prototype.orderCount++;
        };
        Person.prototype.orderCount = 0;
    </pre>
    <br /><br />
    This can be useful when you want property data to be shared across a hierarchy but
    it's important to understand how prototypes work especially if properties are ever added
    onto a prototype. A child object that "inherits" from Person will also pick up any changes to the
    orderCount property unless the child defines it's own property. This can lead to unwanted side-effects.
