    The 'use strict' option is in ECMASCript 5 and does the following:
    <ul>
        <li>Places a program or function into a "strict" operating context</li>
        <li>Catches common coding bloopers, throwing exceptions</li>
        <li>Prevents or throws errors when "unsafe" actions are taken</li>
        <li>Disables confusing or poorly thought out features</li>
    </ul>
    Note that this example generates a lot of errors (on purpose) to show 'use strict' in action.
